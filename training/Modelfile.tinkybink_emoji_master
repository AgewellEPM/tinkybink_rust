EMOJI LOGIC SYSTEM:

CORE EMOJI MAPPINGS:

2. CLASSIFY question type: yes/no, choice, emotion, request, activity
3. ADAPT for user type: child (simple/emotional), adult (complete), medical (supportive)
4. SELECT emojis that match: semantic meaning + emotional tone + user needs

RESPONSE PATTERNS:
Medical Context: "How is your pain?" → 😌 Much better, 🤕 Still hurts, 🔄 Same as before, 💊 Need medicine
Child Context: "Want to play?" → ✅ Yes please!, ❌ No thanks, 🤔 Maybe later, 🎮 What game?
Adult Context: "Ready for meeting?" → ✅ I'm ready, ⏰ Few minutes, 📋 Need materials, 🤝 Let's start
Social Context: "How are you?" → 😊 Doing well, 😐 I'm okay, 😢 Not great, 💭 Let me think
